# GDN HLS Optimisation Log (single-layer attention)

This document records the iterative optimisation passes applied to
`gdn_attn_forward` (single-layer GDN attention, top function in `gdn_model.cpp`).
Each pass is verified by C-level parity against the Python golden reference and
by Vitis HLS 2022.1 csynth on the canonical target `xcu55c-fsvh2892-2L-e`
(Alveo U55C) at a 10 ns target clock, run via `test_single_GDN_attn.tcl`.

## Current post-v7 architecture update

The v1-v7 log below describes the pre-systolic design, whose final state used
the optimized tiled GEMM. The current architecture has since replaced the large
projection tiled GEMMs with a systolic/dataflow matmul kernel. The tiled kernel
remains as a fallback for A/B projections (`out_dim=8`).

Current docs:

- [architecture.md](architecture.md) -- current top-level architecture and
  synthesis snapshot.
- [systolic_matmul.md](systolic_matmul.md) -- current systolic-array matmul
  design and resource breakdown.
- [tiled_matmul.md](tiled_matmul.md) -- legacy/fallback tiled GEMM and the
  pre-systolic baseline.

The latency reduction is modest because the matmul still dominates (7 × 20.18 G
cycles ≈ 141.3 G of the 141.5 G total); the matmul's fundamental bottleneck is
the per-tile load/store overhead through the shared `gmem` AXI port. Lifting
that further requires structural changes (dataflow + streaming GEMM, tier-2
work).

What v1–v7 *did* achieve (U55C v7 vs v0 baseline):
- All compute-bound II violations are gone — every accumulator that was
  scalar-dependence-bound now runs at II=1.
- Top-level timing **closes** at 100 MHz (slack 0.00 ns vs −0.46 ns at v0).
- The conv1d phase is 86× faster (759 M → 8.75 M cycles per call).
- The output-norm phase is 40× faster (685 M → 17.24 M).
- The recurrent-attention phase is 11 % faster (175.9 M → 157.29 M).
- The matmul inner compute loop runs at II=1 (was II=2).
- BRAM_18K usage drops by ~3× (938 → 322) — HLS uses a denser per-partition
  state mapping on U55C than it did on the prior VU11P iteration runs.

## Iteration map (per pass)

Each iteration was verified for parity (`gdn_attn_test`) before re-running
`vitis_hls -f test_single_GDN_attn.tcl`. Numbers below are after the change
of that iteration only.

### v1 — local-fix sweep
*Goal: clean up obvious II offenders without restructuring.*

- **`delta_out` → `delta_out` + `delta_drain`** (`gdn_recurrent_attention`):
  16 simultaneous m_axi stores on shared `gmem` forced II=16. Split into a
  pure-on-chip compute pass (II=1, P_K=16) into `out_loc[256]`, and a separate
  drain loop (II=1, sequential) writing to AXI.
  - Result: 371 → 358 cyc per call.

- **`onorm_sq` / `onorm_gate` → on-chip buffer + multi-lane partial accs**
  (`gdn_output_norm_and_gate`): The original loop read `attn_head[i]` via
  m_axi inside the same iteration that wrote it, producing a distance-1 carried
  AXI dep (II=160). Added local `attn_loc[256]`, `gate_loc[256]`, pre-loaded
  shared `weight_loc[256]` once outside the token loop.
  - Result: `onorm_gate` 40,962 → 344 cyc; `onorm_sq` 846 → 587 cyc.

- **`mm_comp_k` partial accumulators** (`gdn_matmul`): tried 8-lane partial
  sums to break the FP32 fadd carried dep on `local_out[r][c]`. HLS muxed the
  lane-indexed array into a single mux-register and the dep tracker re-detected
  it. Net effect was modest — relied on auto-flatten.
  - Result: II=2 unchanged but the auto-flattened body trip went 16×16 → 256
    iters, saving fill overhead.

- **`load_qk`, `dot_alpha` partial accumulators** — same pattern, same outcome
  (II=3→2 for `load_qk` from dropping `double` to `float`).

- **`conv_kern` unrolled, `conv_col` pipelined**: the original `conv_kern`
  inner loop ran at II=3 (scalar `sum +=`). Unrolling exposed 4 parallel m_axi
  loads of `in[]` and `weights[]`, which the single `gmem` port couldn't
  service in one cycle. `conv_col` failed to pipeline → 759 M → 1.74 G cyc.
  **Reverted in v3**.

### v2 — re-synth, conv refactor
- Re-synth confirmed the v1 changes; conv regression confirmed.
- Removed `conv_kern` unroll; rewrote conv with 4-row sliding window and
  pre-loaded weights, but with the load+shift+compute+write all fused into one
  col loop. The single fused loop touched both `gmem.read` (in) and
  `gmem.write` (out) per iter, and HLS treated this as a carried AXI dep on the
  shared `gmem` port → II=155.
  - Result: conv 759 M → 1.74 G (worse than v1).

### v3 — matmul loop swap, conv 2-phase split
- **Matmul loop nest swap**: changed pipelined dim from `mm_comp_k` (with
  unrolled `c` and a carried dep on `local_out[r][c]`) to `mm_comp_c` (with
  unrolled `k` and a fresh `dot` per iter). HLS still couldn't flatten with
  `mm_comp_r` (warning: "outer loop is not a perfect loop") so each `r` paid
  16 pipeline-fills. HLS also serialised the unrolled `dot += ...` chain
  rather than auto-tree-balancing.
  - Result: matmul 24.3 G → 38.9 G (regression, depth=55).
- **Conv 2-phase split**: separated `conv_load` (m_axi read of `in[]`,
  shift the window) from `conv_compute` (read window + weights, m_axi write
  of `out[]`). With each phase touching only one direction of the gmem port,
  both pipeline at II=1.
  - Result: conv 1.74 G → 8.76 M (200× faster than v2, 86× faster than v1).

### v4 — manual flatten + explicit fadd tree for matmul
*Goal: get matmul to a true II=1 with one combined R×C pipeline.*

- Collapsed `mm_comp_r` and `mm_comp_c` into a single `mm_comp_rc` loop with
  manual `r = rc / MM_TILE_C; c = rc % MM_TILE_C;` indexing (HLS would not
  auto-flatten because the parent tile loops have non-perfect bodies).
- Wrote the 16-input dot product as an explicit balanced 4-level paired-sum
  tree (instead of `for k: dot += ...`), so the critical path is log₂(16)
  fadd stages.
- Added `#pragma HLS dependence variable=local_out type=inter direction=RAW
  false`. The dep is genuinely false because each `rc` iter touches a unique
  `(r, c)` pair, and `dim 2 complete` partition makes each `c` an independent
  register bank.
  - Result: matmul 38.9 G → 20.18 G; per tile_c iter went 1456 → 1271 cyc;
    `mm_comp_rc` II=1, depth 19; total 272 G → 141.5 G.

### v5 — store-products + tree-reduce for `load_qk`/`dot_alpha`/`onorm_sq`
- The lane-indexed partial accumulators kept failing because HLS muxed them
  into a single register. Replaced with the same pattern that worked in
  matmul: each iteration writes a unique scratch element (no carried dep), a
  separate phase reduces.
- Initial reduction used `for (j) { #pragma HLS unroll; sum += arr[j]; }` —
  this *unrolled* but HLS emitted a 256-deep serial fadd chain rather than a
  tree. `onorm_sq_reduce` became 256 × 4 cycles = 1024 cyc per call,
  cancelling the II=1 gains.
  - Result (mixed): `dot_alpha` and `onorm_sq` hit II=1 but the linear
    reduction ate the savings; total essentially unchanged from v4.

### v6 — explicit balanced tree for 256-input reductions
- Wrote `gdn_tree_reduce_256()` as an `inline` helper with 8 explicit levels
  (256 → 128 → 64 → … → 1), each fully unrolled. Used it for `q_sq`, `k_sq`,
  `alpha`, and `sum` in onorm.
  - Result: recurrent 162.15 → **162.15** M (effectively same as v4),
    onorm 33.7 → **17.3** M (best yet, 19 % below v4).

### v7 — split q/k onto separate AXI bundles
- Last remaining II violation was `load_qk` II=2 from HLS 200-885 ("limited
  memory ports"): two simultaneous m_axi reads of `q_head[]` and `k_head[]` on
  the shared `gmem` bundle. Added `bundle=mem_q` to `q` and `bundle=mem_k` to
  `k` on the top-level `gdn_attn_forward`'s m_axi pragmas.
  - Result: `load_qk` II=2 → **II=1**, depth 76 → 4, 587 → 258 cyc per call.
  - Side effect: HLS replicated the matmul and conv into `_1` and `_2`
    instances because some calls now read from `mem_q`/`mem_k` rather than
    `gmem`. Resource cost is real (BRAM +32, DSP +101, LUT +20 k) but
    utilisation stays under 25 %.
  - Recurrent attention 162.2 → **157.29** M (U55C re-measurement),
    top-level 141.51 → **141.03** G.

No II violations remain on U55C. Only `Cannot flatten` informational
warnings (HLS 200-960, harmless). Top-level timing slack is **0.00 ns** at
the 100 MHz target — the design closes timing with zero margin.

## Critical follow-ups after v7

1. **Streaming/dataflow GEMM** — completed for large projections by the current
   systolic matmul design. See [systolic_matmul.md](systolic_matmul.md). The
   remaining matmul follow-up is improving the integrated `ReadB` schedule,
   which currently reports II=16 in the single-attention systolic report.
2. **`gdn_attn_forward` macro-stage dataflow** — wrap the body
   (matmul → conv → recurrent → onorm → matmul) in a `dataflow` region with
   `hls::stream` between stages. Eliminates the three `attn_conv_copy_*` AXI
   round-trips and overlaps the projection matmuls with the recurrent step.
3. **`a` and `b` AXI bundle split** — these are tiny (504 floats each) but read
   inside `gdn_recurrent_attention`'s scalar-gate prologue; if combined with q/k
   on a wider mux, the gate path could pipeline tighter.
4. **Higher clock target** — top-level slack is 0.00 ns at 10 ns target on
   U55C, so any clock pull-in (e.g. 9 ns / 111 MHz) needs additional pipeline
   stages on the longest fadd combinational paths. `bind_op op=fadd
   latency=8` on the tree-reduce sites would buy headroom at the cost of
   ~2 % more cycles in those pipelines.
